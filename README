Porthole 0.6.0 (April, 2008)
===========================

Porthole is a GTK-based frontend for Portage (the Gentoo package
management system, http://www.gentoo.org/). It features a hierarchial
view of packages and supports fast searches and dependency
calculations. Porthole also supports basic emerge features (emerge,
unmerge, sync, upgrade world).

Porthole is released under the GPL, see COPYING.

Porthole is partially based on an earlier program, called gportage
(http://www.stacken.kth.se/~foo/gentoo/), which has been discontinued
in favour of Porthole.

= How to install Portole =
==========================

The easiest and recommended way of installing Porthole is by using the
ebuild that is available from the webpage or portage tree. We assume you know how to
put ebuilds in the portage overlay. If not, please consult the
documentation and forums on the Gentoo web site (http://www.gentoo.org),
or follow the instructions on the Gentoo Wiki at 
http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Installing_3rd_Party_Ebuilds.

If you don't want to use the ebuild, you can download the tarball
(porthole-0.5.0.tar.bz2) and install it yourself.

Porthole requires:
>=python-2.3
>=PyGTK-2.4
>=libglade-2.5.0
and, of course, Portage


to install:
> tar xvjf porthole-0.6.0.tar.bz2
> cd porthole-0.6.0
> python setup.py install
