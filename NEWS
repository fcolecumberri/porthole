0.6.0:
    * Major slice and dice operation to split up the different files into more manageable modules.
    There are several new internal db modules for serving and handling the main package db,
    user configs, porthole preferences, etc..  This has sped things up quite a bit.
    
    * Sets support is now partially integrated.  I have not had the time, etc. to handle package 
    atoms properly, nor does it handle non-installed packages in the set.  So that means it is 
    still up to you to make all the correct choices.
    
    * new user configs addition to the summary view showing any entries for the package in any of 
    the /etc/portage/package.*  files as well as any /etc/portage/sets/* files.
    
    * package versions are now fully selectable for summary and other tab dispalys.
    
    * Improved dependency listings with much more info presented about their status and needs.
    
    * New dependency pop-up window when a dependency is dbl-clicked.  Multiple levels of dependencies
        can be followed with additional popups
    
    * Re-vamp of the Summary View USE flag output.  porthhole now obtains final ebuild environment
        settings for the flags.  It should now be a 100% match to emerge output.
    
    * New, updated "Settings" menu options to the most probably used emerge options.
    
    * Upgrades now possibly require some additional "Settings" menu options to be set manually
        for now.  To avaoid multiple emerges for a package the --noreplace and --update options should be set.
    
    * New Sets and Deprecated views for better package management.
    
    * Newly recoded config saving so that it creates file headers and comments for any user config
        changes done through porthole.
        
    * Newly redone right click menus in the Summary view with better mask/unmask, keyword acceptance
       and submenu options for controlling version selection, etc..
    
    * bug fix the terminal display losing the gcc output.
    
    * new queue pause and run icons/functions, a timer is not yet implememnted.

    * numerous portage updates.
    
    * numerous gtk+ updates
    
    * 2 plug-ins 1) Etc-proposals  2)Profuse included and auto-detect if their target package is available.
    
    * numerous bugfixes
    
    * fix advanced emerge keyword acceptance and turn off underline for hot key use so a '_' in a
        keyword will display correctly.
    
    * fix USE flag display by turning off label underline support used for hotkey shortcuts.
    
    * update dependency crunching code to allow '?' due to required USE flag conditionals.
    
    *** It has been so long that I have probably forgotten most of the changes made to list them.


0.5.0:

     * Added columns to package list view, displaying installed version, recommended version,
        download size, and short package description for all packages in list.

     * Added plugin interface

     * Added preliminary right-click menus to package list and package summary

     * Added select-all, de-select-all options to right-click menu for upgradable view
       (RFE [939337])

     * Added code to interact with user config files such as package.keywords and make.conf.
       Added options to add or remove ebuilds or packages from certain config files in
       package list right-click, package summary right-click, and advemerge dialog.
       Added option to update use flags to make.conf or package.use in advemerge dialog.

     * Added preliminary sudo functionality

     * Added Configuration GUI

     * Modified Main Window GUI

     * Added command preview to advemerge dialog

     * Added version table to summary (like on packages.gentoo.org)

     * Improved calculation and display of dependancies

     * Added colour to terminal window for emerge output. Also added user-settable font
       and fixed display of "updating portage cache" percentage.

     * Set to forward keyboard input to the terminal process if it's in focus.

     * Improved handling of masked packages. In the advemerge dialog, the recommended
       version is selected by default, and Porthole no longer indicates packages for which
       all higher versions are masked as upgradable.

     * Added emerge-webrsync functionality

     * Added scrollable window to advemerge dialog for high numbers of use flags

     * Set colour and font weight of info in package list depending on installed / upgradable status

     * Set to highlight items that may require user action in the terminal summary tab

     * Added custom web-browser choice

     * Set to properly clean up emerge processes when finished (bug [1081506, 1119366])

     * Set to remember selected category / package after changing views or reloading db

     * Allowed sorting of package list by installed / recommended / size columns.

     * Added icon to indicate if the user has not run Porthole as root (RFE [1181795])

     * Set to remember main window maximized state


0.4.0:
     * Added the date & time of the last sync to the "Sync" button tooltip

     * changed the chagelog loading to to check the portage overlay directory if a changelog
       is not found. Then try decoding it using utf_8 first (soon to be the official
       encoding method).  If that fails then try decoding using iso-8859-1 which many
       new changelogs are saved with that encoding.  Finally failing both those it
       displays "an unknown encoding method" error instead.

     * Changed the summary view to use the better of the (best unmasked or installed masked
       ebuild version) or the best masked version if no unmasked version is available.
       It also diplays which ebuild version was used for the properties display.

     * eliminated unnesseary DB reloads if running custom commands with the -p flag.
     
     * The view can be changed from the upgrades view while it is loading to another
       one with out disruption when the loading is complete.  Switching back to the
       upgrades view when the user is ready.

     * Added confirmation that you want to kill a running process when the quit/close
       button is selected in either window.
      
     * Starting a upgrades load then switching to a different view is not interupted
       with the upgrades list when complete.  The upgrades view needs to be selected
       again to see it.  That way it does not disrupt what you are doing/looking at.
      
     * some code changes to work with both newer & depricated gtk functions.  It should
       work without printing deprication warnings or function call errors/failures.

     * updated to use the new & pre portage-2.0.51 as the world file is relocated
       as of 2.0.51

     * Added an internal progress bar in a second statusbar on the main window.
       I will probably merge the 2 statusbars in the future, depending on feedback.
       The new progress bar does not tie up the gui from any other interation like
       the dialog box did until it was closed.
      
     * Advanced emerge toolbar option & dialog giving fairly easy access to most
       advanced emerge features & options.  TOC worked hard on this one and I think
       he did a great job on it.
      
     * Help is now working (not complete) with a good start on the basics and help on the advanced
       emerge options.
      
     * The web browser is now opened from a threaded function call so that it does not
       tie up the gui untill it is closed.  It also is used to open a browser to the
       help files that are now in porthole.
      
     * Database reloads can be manually activated by menu option.  Good for when an
       emerge has taken place independantly from an open porthole session.
      
     * Portage modules imported into porthole can be manually reloaded in order for
       porthole to see changes in /etc/make.conf, etc.  Also usefull if portage was
       updated to a new version .  It will reload the new version just emerged.
       
     * Added pycrash detection and inclusion into porthole.  The crash log file saved
       can be very usefull for debugging.
       
     * Selectable upgrades only or standard upgrade/downgrade upgrades list selection

     * Intermittent autoscroll bug now fixed.
     
     * Porthole now uses a semaphore system to prevent collisions accessing or modifying
       variables by different/threaded program modules, functions.   It has helped prevent
       many of the crashes/segfaults.
       
     * gettext internationalization support now started.  Most text strings are now marked,
       readying for full translation/localization.

     * improved terminal output, so that wget, etc. display their progress bar, etc.
     
     * numerous other bug fixes.
     
     * Changed the default window size to something quite small.  For those that start porthole
       in lower resolutions.  It remembers any size changes between sessions anyway.

     * Added  a -h, --help option to portholes command line interface

     * The version sorting routine has been re-written again, portage is/has just
       changed it's version comparison code.  Also the code I released in -0.3.1
       also failed badly for a few odd version strings.

     * The hyperlinks for home pages has been patched to fix  multiple homepage listings
       in the summary view.  Thanks to jonathanl for this patch.

     * the terminal process view will show the download progress almost like it would in
       a normal terminal.

     * The browser opens from a threaded function now so that the rest of porthole
       will no longer be frozen until the browser is closed.  It also now allows multiple
       pages to be opened.

     * The gtk horizontal pane bug is now caught and corrected as porthole opens.
 
     * On completion of a terminal task the main porthole db is now reloaded without
       disrupting the current view.  The package being viewed is reloaded automatically.
       The upgrades view is the only one that requires a disruptive rebuild.  Sorry, I
       could not get it to work non-disruptively.  I believe it is due to the checkboxes.

     * The settings menu now has the "ALLOW DOWNGRADES" (--upgradeonly) setting (opposite
       to the flag setting) to help fix some package upgrade issues.  Be careful with it's
       setting as it can sometimes change expected emerge behavior when not upgrading packages.

     * USE flags are now displayed with a +/- as well as being colored to show their current
       setting.   Original feature patch submitted by jonathanl.

0.3.1:

     * This release is primarily a bugfix release.  There have been quite a
       few bugfixes due to submisissions from users and our own testing.

       Thank you to all those that have helped make this release a good one.

     * Kill/Resume has been fixed to work correctly.  Porthole now sends a
       <ctrl>C to the running process to allow it to quit gracefully, so
       emerge can save any info it needs to resume.

     * A new "Resume" option has been added, "Skip Queue item", to skip a
       killed emerge sitting in the queue so that you can continue with the
       remaining entries in the queue.

     * Killed processes now send the callback signal to the main window so that
       any succefully emerged/unmerged packages will show in the change.

     * You can now double click on a line in any of the filtered views tabs and it
       will bring you to that line in the process view tab.  It will attempt to
       place the line in the center of the process view tab.

     * A new portage compliant sort routine for all the available ebuilds.
       It now will sort correctly every time (I Hope).  It will lengthen
       version strings to the same length (# of subversions [x.x.x]).
       All version numbers are formattted to the same length with leading
       zeros so that they can be correctly sorted alphabetically.

     * Dependacy display bugs have been fixed.

     * several bugs dealing with greyed out text/menus/icons have been fixed.

     * We have renamed a few things that were causing some confusion.   The
       "Info" tab was renamed to "Summary" to better reflect its contents.
       The menu item "Save As Log" ==> "Save Log As".
       The "Process Terminated" message is now "Process Complete".

     * the search string will not accept special regular expression characters
       to use in its search.  They will be escaped to be used as text characters.
       That way a search for "c++" will use the search string "c\+\+".
       The ++ would otherwise cause a reg. expression error due to multiple +'s.

     * a little fine tuning to the autoscroll feature.  Note there seems to be a
       bug in gtk that is causing the autocroll sticky feature to snap back to
       fixed point in the buffer at times.  When the process stops you will be able to
       scroll to the end again.
       
       


0.3:

     * Emerge sync is fully functional again.

     * Totally new terminal window, with tabs for information, warnings, a 
       package queue, etc... 

     * Process output is now also color coded to help make certain parts 
       stand out.

     * An emerge queue so that multiple packages can be queued up to be 
       emerged. The queue is fully editable via the new terminal window.

     * Emerges can be resumed after being killed.

     * Preferences are now stored in an XML file.

     * Logs of emerges can be saved and viewed.

     * Custom commands can be run, for example "emerge --no-deps package".

     * A ChangeLog tab has been added in the main window.

     * An Installed Files tab has been added in the main window.

     * Descriptions can be included in searches.

0.2:

     * Emerge sync has been temporarily disabled due to technical problems.

     * Fixed bug 883881 - Icons will now refresh after an emerge.

     * Doesn't show Unmerge button unless the selected package is installed.

     * Removed sudo stuff; users will have to run porthole as root for
       emerge functionality.

     * Added porthole.desktop menu entry.

     * Allow installing without an X server running.

     * Added options --fetchonly and --verbose.

     * There is an Upgradable Packages view. You can select packages
       to upgrade. Packages in the world file should be selected by
       default.

     * Icons for upgradable packages are no longer shown because it
       was too slow.

     * Settings and window positions are saved to $HOME/.porthole/prefs.


0.1:

     * Initial release.
