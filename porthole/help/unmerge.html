<h1>Remove a Package</h1>

<h2>Basic Removal</h2>
<p>The simplest way to remove a package from your system is to select
the package from the package list, then click the "Unmerge" button in
the toolbar. This will almost always do what you want.</p>
<p>However, this will not remove any dependencies that were installed
when you installed the package. The safest way to remove these
dependencies is to run the <a href="custcmd.html">custom command</a> "emerge --pretend --depclean", then manually remove the packages&nbsp;it returns that you know you don't need.</p>
<p>If any package complains about missing dependencies - make sure you reinstall the <span style="font-style: italic;">package that complains</span>.</p>
<h2>Removing a Specific Version</h2>
<p>If you want to remove a specific version of a package (perhaps you
have multiple versions of a package installed and one is now
unnecessary), you can do so with the <a href="advemerge.html">Advanced Emerge</a> dialog, or equivalently you can right-click on the version you want to uninstall in the package summary, and select "Unmerge".</p>
<h2>Advanced Dependency Removal</h2>
<p>If you really want to get rid of all those useless dependencies,
you're sure you don't need any of the packages output by "emerge
--pretend --depclean", and you've read all the warnings it output twice
over, then run the <a href="custcmd.html">custom command</a> "emerge --depclean". If you change your mind while it's unmerging, hit &lt;Ctrl&gt;+C in the <a href="termwindow.html">terminal window</a> or press the "Kill" button to stop it.</p>
