<h1>Find a Package</h1>

<h2>Category Navigation</h2>
<p>If you know what category the package will be listed under, you can
select it from the category list, then manually find the package. If
you start typing while a package or category is selected Porthole will
quickly skip to the package or category name you seem to be typing.
Also note that you can click on the headers of the columns in the
package list to sort the list by that column.</p>
<h2>Searches</h2>
<p>To search for a package, enter the name, or part of the name, into
the search bar, then either press&nbsp;Enter or click on the "Find"
button to the right of the search bar.</p>
<p>All packages with the search term in their name will be displayed,
and if the search term corresponds exactly to a package name, that
package will be selected. A list of previous searches will replace the
category list, so you can go back and review the results.</p>
<p>If you want to search the package descriptions as well as the names,
select "Search Descriptions" under the "Settings" menu. The first
search after enabling this may take some time, while Porthole completes updating a
database of all the descriptions after a sync.</p>
