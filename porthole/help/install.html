<h1>Install a Package</h1>

<h2>Basic Install</h2>
<p>The simplest way to install a package, is to find the package in the
package tree, select it, then click the "Emerge" button. This will
automatically install the latest stable version of the package, along
with any dependencies it has that aren't already installed.</p>
<p>For example, to install The GIMP, you could select "media" then
"gfx" from the category list, then select the package named "gimp" and
click "Emerge". Alternatively, entering "gimp" into Porthole's search
bar would find all packages with "gimp" in the name, and automatically
select the one named only "gimp" for you.</p>
<h2>Accepting Keywords</h2>
<p>Occasionally you may decide that you absolutely have to have the
latest version of a package and you don't care if this particular
package is unstable or not. If there is a newer version of a package
that is marked as unstable for your CPU architecture, you can
right-click on the package and select "Add with ~arch to
package.keywords" where "arch" is an abbreviation for your CPU
architecture. This will enable you to install the latest unstable
version of this package every time a new version appears inthe portage
tree, just as you would install a package normally.</p>
<p>Please note that Porthole is not well tested and there is the
possibility that it will chew up. mutilate, or otherwise render useless
your current package.keywords file. It is recommended that you make a
backup of this file (usually /etc/portage/package.keywords) before
accepting keywords with Porthole. Of course, if you haven't edited it
yourself, chances are it's empty to start off with anyway :).</p>
<h2>Advanced Install</h2>
<p>For finer control of emerge options, use flags and versions, select
the package to emerge then click the "Advanced Emerge" toolbar button.
This allows you to select which version of the package you wish to
install, and to modify the use flags it will be compiled with as well
as selecting other options to pass to emerge, such as --fetchonly or
--onlydeps. Refer to the&nbsp;<a href="advemerge.html">Advanced Emerge</a> help topic for more information.</p>
<h2>Semi-Advanced Lazy Install</h2>
<p>If you just want to choose which version of a package to install
yourself, and unmask only that version if need be, you can quickly and
easily do this by right-clicking on the version table in the package
summary (displayed in the bottom pane of the main window).</p>
<p>If you click on a keyword masked version of the package, it will
allow you to modify package.keywords as described above. In addition
however, if you click on a hard masked package, it will allow you to
add it to your package.unmask file, and thus emerge it. Before you
unmask a hard masked package, <span style="font-weight: bold;">always</span>
read the masking reason, which is displayed as a tool-tip when you
hover the mouse-cursor over the hard masked version. There is always a
good reason for packages to be hard masked, and if you don't know
exactly what it is, don't unmask it!</p>
