<h1>Terminal Window</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Porthole is just a front-end for the emerge command which can generate 
 amazing amounts of output.
 &nbsp;The challenge for most users is to discover what's important
 and what is not out of the thousands of lines of emerge output.
 &nbsp;Porthole's answer to this challenge is it's terminal window <em>(figure 1)</em>.
</p>
<p>The terminal window filters out warnings, cautions and summary information into 
separate tabs.
 &nbsp;This allows the user to find critical information that would normally be
like finding a needle in a haystack.
 &nbsp;In addition, different types of information are color-coded for emphasis.
</p>
 
<p>
The terminal window consists of a menu bar and five tabs.
 &nbsp;The tabs appear only as needed.
 &nbsp;For example, if there were no warnings found, the warning tab 
 will never be visible.
</p>

<p>
The terminal window also supports an emerge queue so you can select
more than one package to install without having to wait
for the previous one to finish!
</p>

<h2>Menu Bar</h2>



<h3>Process Menu</h3>

<ul>

  <li><u>Resume</u> - Restart an emerge command that was killed.
  </li>
  <li><u>Kill Process</u> - Kill the currently running process.
  </li>
  <li><u>Save Log</u> - Save the contents of the process window to a file.
 &nbsp;The default directory is /home/<i>userid</i>/.porthole/.
 &nbsp;Saving the log automatically clears the process, caution,
 warning and summary tabs.<i>  If the tab buffers are large it could take a while
 to clear &amp; release the memory, be patient.</i>
  </li>
  <li><u>Save Log As</u> - Save the contents of the process window to a file.
 &nbsp;The default directory is /home/<i>userid</i>/.porthole/.
  </li>
  <li><u>Open Log</u> - Opens a previously saved log
  </li>
  <li><u>Close Window</u> - Close the terminal window.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Edit Menu</h3>

<ul>

  <li><u>Clear</u> - Empties the process, caution, warning and summary tabs.
    <i>  If the tab buffers are large it could take a while to clear &amp; release the memory, be patient.</i>
 &nbsp;
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Queue Menu</h3>

<ul>

  <li><u>Pause</u> - Do not start the next command in the queue, if one exists. 
  </li>
  <li><u>Resume</u> - Start the next queue command when the terminal is ready for it. 
  </li>
  <li><u>Timer</u> - (not yet coded) Set a timer to start and stop sending queued commands to the process terminal. 
  </li>
  <li><u>Move Up</u> - Move the selected queue item up one position. 
  </li>
  <li><u>Move Down</u> - Move the selected queue item down one position.
  </li>
  <li><u>Remove</u> - Remove the item from the queue.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Process Tab</h2>

<p>
The process tab <em>(figure 1)</em> holds the raw emerge command output.
 &nbsp;The process tab has a built-in kill button that performs the
same action as the Process -&gt; Kill Process menu.
 &nbsp;Each line of output is numbered for reference in the summary
and warning tabs.
</p>
<p>
Color coding is applied to certain lines to highlight the
 following situations:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>The beginning of each command.
    <br>
E.G.
 <span class="command">*** emerge --nospinner =dev-dotnet/pnetc-0.6.2 ***</span>
  </li>
  <li>The beginning of each emerge.
    <br>
E.G.
 <span class="emerge">&gt;&gt;&gt; emerge (3 of 4) dev-dotnet/pnetlib-0.6.2 to /</span>
    <div class="tipright">
TIP! You can change the color coding scheme, 
 see the help section on "Customizing Porthole".
    </div>

  </li>
  <li>Warning messages.
    <br>
E.G.
 <span class="warning">cg_arith.tc:360: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>Informational text.
    <br>
E.G.
  <span class="info"> * Use /etc/init.d/dotnet to register your runtime</span></li>
  <li>Error messages.
    <br>
E.G.
  <span class="error">!!! Error calculating dependencies. Please correct.</span></li>
  <li>Porthole generated notes.
    <br>
E.G.
  <span class="appnote">*** Based on the build history of these packages on
 your system, I can estimate that emerging them usually takes, on average, 
0 days, 0 hrs, 0 mins, and 39 secs
    </span></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that when you run a emerge --pretend, Porthole will look through the emerge
history and try to find how long it will take to emerge
that package.
 &nbsp;That information will be highlighted in the note color.
</p>

Figure 2. Warning tab
</div>

<h2>Warning/Caution Tab</h2>

<p>
Porthole will filter out any warnings/cautions and place them into the 
corresponding tab <em>(figure 2)</em>.
 &nbsp;In addition to warnings/cautions these tabs also
display the command and emerge information lines using
the color coding scheme.
 &nbsp;This allows you to identify which package the messages originated from.
</p>

<p>
One of the really useful features of this tab is the ability to jump
 directly to the message location in the process terminal by simply
double-clicking on the line in question.
 &nbsp;When you do this Porthole will switch to the process tab and 
bring the desired line into focus near the center of the tab's window.
 &nbsp; When you find an error it is good to check the process window
 because there may be additional lines associated with the error that
were not picked up by the filter.

Figure 3. Summary Tab
</div>

<h2>Summary Tab</h2>

<p>
Like the warning/caution tab, the summary tab <em>(figure 3)</em> is a filtered view of the 
process window.
 &nbsp;Unlike the others though, it displays not only informational mesages
but major error messages as well.
</p>

<div class="tipleft">
TIP! Carefully review the summary tab after the emerge is complete
for important instructions!
</div>

<p>Porthole also attempts to filter messages that direct you to perform
additional actions after the emerge is complete like the reminder to 
run etc-update.
</p>

<p>
It also displays the command and emerge information lines using
the color coding scheme so you can identify the origin of the message.
</p>

<p>
The summary tab also supports double-clicking on the line number to open
the process window.
</p>

Figure 4. Queue tab
</div>

<h2>Queue Tab</h2>

<p>
The queue <em>(figure 4)</em> displays a list of all the packages selected for emerge and 
displays the status of the emerge.
 &nbsp;Each line in the queue lists first the package short name 
followed by the full command string.
 </p>

<p>
Status is represented via icons which are described below.
 &nbsp;Please be aware that different schemes will use different icons, so
your system may not look exactly like this.  The following descriptions
 refer to figure 4 as an example. 
</p>

<ul>

  <li>Complete/Successful - a checkmark (like textinfo, autoconf)
  </li>
  <li>Error/Unsuccessful - red circle with a white X (like glibmm)
  </li>
  <li>Process killed - red X (like aspell-cs)
  </li>
  <li>Process is running - a gear (like aspell-br)
  </li>
  <li>Waiting to run - no icon
  </li>
</ul>
