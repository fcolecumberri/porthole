<h1>Customizing Porthole</h1>

<h2>Porthole's Configuration Dialog</h2>

<p>To configure many features of Porthole, select "Configure
Porthole" from the "Settings" menu. Click on one of the&nbsp;tabs
on the left-hand side of the window to access specific settings. If
you're not sure what a particular setting will do, hover the mouse
cursor over it for an explanatory tool-tip.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">"General" Tab</h2>

<p>This tab holds settings applicable to more than one part
of&nbsp;Porthole, or those that don't fit in any of the other tabs.</p>

<p>Your current CPU architecture will be displayed at the top,
for reference. This is determined by Portage and cannot be changed.</p>

<p>Below this is the "Enable Archlist" setting. There are some
parts of Porthole where it is possible to see information displayed for
<span style="font-weight: bold;">CPU architectures other
than your own</span> (such as in the version table in the package
summary). Enable this, and select which architectures to display
information for if you wish to see this extra information. This setting
is disabled by default.</p>

<p>If Porthole is not opening your <span style="font-weight: bold;">preferred web browser</span>
when you click on the help buttons, or the home page link in the
package summary, then you can either set your <span style="font-weight: bold;">BROWSER</span> environment variable
or set it here. Select the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Use Custom Browser</span>" radio button, then type
the command used to start your browser in the text box below it. It will usualy be
sufficient to simply type the name of your browser (for example, "firefox") into this box. If you want to
specify the exact command to open the browser, use "%s" where you want
the webpage or help-file location to be substituted in as well as any other options you desire.  
In most cases simply entering 'firefox' will will get the pre-defined python <span style="font-weight: bold;">Firefox</span>
webbrowser module with its default options.
If it does not find a pre-configured webbrowser module it will create a generic module with the '%s' url parameter added for you.</p>

<p>If you want to use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">emerge-webrsync</span>
command to sync your portage tree, select "emerge-webrsync" from the
list box labelled "Sync Method".</p>

<h2>"Main Window" Tab</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <h4>Font and Colours Tab<br>

    </h4>

    <p>Here you can select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">colours</span> used to
indicate packages that Portage recommends <span style="font-weight: bold;">upgrading</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">downgrading</span>.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Summary View Tab</h4>

    <p>Here you can choose which <span style="font-weight: bold;">items will be displayed in the
summary view</span>. There is be a small amount of redundancy in
the information presented by default.</p>

  </li>

</ul>

<h2>"Emerge" Tab</h2>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">emerge
options</span> selected at the top will be passed onto emerge
whenever you emerge or unmerge a package with Porthole. Hover the mouse
cursor over the options to get a quick explanation of what they do.</p>

<p>Under <span style="font-weight: bold;">advanced
emerge options</span>, you can enable the "Commit to make.conf"
button in the Advanced Emerge dialog. WARNING! This will allow Porthole
to directly modify your make.conf file, which is <span style="font-style: italic;">very important</span> for
the continued operation of your Gentoo system. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Make sure you
back up this file</span> (usually /etc/make.conf) before letting Porthole modify it! This
feature has <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
been fully tested, and we cannot accept any responsibility if Porthole
somehow messes your&nbsp;system up :).</p>

<p>The remaining text boxes are the first five commands that will
be offered as options in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">run
custom command</span> dialog. If you use this feature regularly,
consider changing some of these to make your life easier.</p>

<h2>"Terminal" Tab</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    <h4>Text Font and Colours Tab</h4>

    <div class="tipright"> <b>Tip!</b> If you
click on a colour selector with the right mouse button, that colour
will follow the default foreground or background colour as applicable.
    </div>

    <p>Here you can modify the <span style="font-weight: bold;">font used for Porthole's terminal</span>
(a good choice is "monospace" to retain the intended formatting of
emerge's output, but it's not generally the most satisfying), and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">highlighting colours used in the
terminal</span>. Note that the colours you select will only be
applied in the "Process" tab of the terminal window, not the "Warning"
or "Summary" tabs. The exception is the "Caution" colour, which is also
used in the Sumamry tab to bring your attention to lines where it looks
like emerge is telling you to perform some important action, and the
"Line Number" colour, which is used in all tabs.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>More Colours Tab</h4>

    <p>Even more colours! If you want you can change the <span style="font-weight: bold;">colours used for emerge output</span>,
you can do it here. The defaults are set to be readable on a white
background, but they're not very stylish.</p>

  </li>

</ul>
