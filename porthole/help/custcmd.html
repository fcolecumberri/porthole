<h1>Custom Commands</h1>


<h2>The Run Custom Command Dialog</h2>


<p>
This dialog interaction is for running emerge with options that are not yet
integrated into Porthole.  Some combinations of commands may never be fully
integrated into porthole's GUI interface, and this allows you to run any custom emerge-related tool you may have lying about.
</p>


<div class="warnleft">
<b>Caution!</b> This dialog is capable of sending <b>any</b> command to porthole's terminal.
Porthole's terminal does not handle all output formatting and is only intended to handle a limited range of commands.
</div>


<p>
The dialog opens with a blank command entry box and a drop down history selector.
The first 6 entries in the history list are "persistent" ones that save you some typing.
All you need to do is select one, fill in any missing info to complete the command.
The remaining entries (if any) are the most recent history of commands actually run from the dialog.
Porthole will remember up to 10 unique entries in total unless you edit your ~.porthole/prefs.xml file
</p>

<h2>Buttons</h2>


<ul>


  <li>Entry box down arrow - displays the entry box history selector
  </li>

  <li>Help - brings up this window
  </li>

  <li>Cancel - closes window without executing an emerge
  </li>

  <li>Execute - Uses the command string entered
and submits it to the terminal window for execution.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<p>Some useful commands to run (as long as you know what they do) are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>emerge --update --deep --newuse world (--pretend --verbose)</li>
  <li>revdep-rebuild</li>
  <li>emerge metadata</li>
</ul>
<p>The following commands are known not to work reliably due to their output formatting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>etc-update</li>
  <li>dispatch-conf</li>
</ul>
