<h1>Sync Portage Tree</h1>


<h2>How to Synchronise your Portage Tree</h2>
<p>Portage keeps its entire record of all packages available to you on
your system. To make sure Portage is aware of the current versions of
packages available to you, you will need to update this record every
once in a while.</p>
<p>It's not hard - just click on the "Sync" button in the Porthole toolbar. Make sure you don't have "Pretend" enabled.</p>
<p>If you are wondering how long it was since your last sync, hover the
cursor over the "Sync" button to display a tooltip with the last sync
time and date.</p>
<h2>emerge-webrsync</h2>
<p>If you need to use emerge-webrsync to update the portage tree,
select "Customise Porthole" from the "Settings" menu. In the "General"
tab of the preferences dialog is an option to use emerge-webrsync in
stead of the ordinary sync command. The sync button will now perform an
emerge-webrsync in stead.</p>
