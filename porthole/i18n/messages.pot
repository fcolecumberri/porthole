"Causes  portage  to  disregard merge records indicating that a config file "

"--pretend and then executing the same command without --pretend, as "

"\"Enter\" key is pressed at the prompt (with no other input), it is "

"--deep (-D)\n"
"This flag forces emerge to consider the entire dependency tree of packages, "
